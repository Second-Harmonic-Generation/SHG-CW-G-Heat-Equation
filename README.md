## 1. About this repository

This repository contains the research article **‚ÄúTemperature Distribution in a Gaussian End-Pumped Nonlinear KTP Crystal: the Temperature Dependence of Thermal Conductivity and Radiation Boundary Condition‚Äù**, together with supporting source code, numerical results, and reproducibility assets.  


Continuous-wave (CW) second harmonic generation in nonlinear crystals is strongly affected by heat dissipation. This work analyzes the **transient temperature distribution** in a KTP crystal under Gaussian end-pumping by solving the nonlinear, inhomogeneous heat equation. Unlike many earlier models, the study incorporates:  

- **Temperature-dependent thermal conductivity** of KTP  
- **Convective and radiative boundary conditions** at crystal surfaces  

A finite difference method (FDM) solver was implemented to numerically evaluate the system. Results show that neglecting thermal conductivity variations leads to significant temperature prediction errors, and while radiative effects are negligible in thin crystals, they become relevant for larger geometries with wide pump beams. These findings improve modeling accuracy for **thermal lensing, phase mismatching, and efficiency reduction** in nonlinear optical systems.
